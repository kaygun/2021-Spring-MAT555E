### What is data analysis for computational sciences?

- We know what *Computational Sciences* are.
- What is *Data Analysis*?

### What is data?

Any collection of symbols can be data as long as they are

- recorded consistently
- collected within the same context
- recalled consistently and accurately

### What is data analysis?

Creates "models" from the data at hand.

### How do we make models?

1. Look at the data, clean it, understand it.
2. Put forth a hypothesis.
3. Choose a model type.
3. Design a fit function.
4. Find the model with optimal parameters.
3. Validate the model.
4. If necessary go back to step 2, 3 or 4.
5. Write a report.

### How is it different than Science?

In any science we do the same.

+ Our domain is fixed.
+ We need deep domain knowledge.
+ Our models are specific to that particular domain.

### How is Data Analysis different than Science?

* Data Analysis models use

  + internal structure of the data
  + are domain agnostic

* Developing these models requires
  - statistical
  - mathematical
  - computational skills
  
### Do we need all of this to do Data Analysis?

* Without coding we cannot compute!
* Without statistics we cannot be sure of the results!
* Without mathematics we cannot fix models when they break!

### Can anyone do Data Analysis without domain knowledge?

Any fool can develop a model! (coding) 

![](200w.gif)

* Deciding whether a model fits is difficult. (domain knowledge)
* Understanding when/where model stops working is difficult. (math/stats)
* Fixing a model when it breaks is difficult. (math)

### What is a model?

+ Data is usually noisy, complex and hard to understand.
+ Model is a simplification.
+ Model is an artificial construct.

>  "All models are wrong, but some are useful." George Box

### What does a model do?

- Models can be 
  + predictive 
  + or descriptive.

### What does "model fits" mean?

* Model construction is an iterative process.
* We get generations of approximations.
* At some point we need to stop.
* We stop when the model "fits".
* Fit can be measured in two dimensions:
  - quantitative (cost/fit function)
  - qualitative (domain knowledge)
  
### Validation

Quantitative fitting 

- under-fitting (high bias)
- over-fitting (high variance)
- bias vs variance trade-off

![Bias/Variance Trade-off](bias-vs-variance.png)

### What type of models are there?

+ Major classes of models are
  - Supervised
  - Unsupervised

+ Most commonly used types of models
  - Regression models
  - Clustering/Classification models
  - Linear algebraic models
  - Entropic models
  - Neural network models
  - Ensemble models
